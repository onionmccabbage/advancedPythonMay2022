Tuesday
- functional programming: parameters
- processing text/json
  - json.loads() takes JSON and returns Python structure
  - json.dumps() takes Python and returns JSON
- persisting files: read/write/append/exclusive/overwrite, text, bytes, json
- databases
  see https://wiki.python.org/moin/DatabaseProgramming
- other db connections
- Create, Read and Update (and DELETE) - CRUD operations
- populate db with sample data
- read and nicely format values from the db
- explore 'typicode' API as a static data source for JSON

- after lunch review exercise 
  ask questions, help each other, share code (screen-share)
- we will be using the 'requests' library on Wednesday
  (you may come across the urllib.requests which is the old-skool way of doing things)

Wednesday
- context manager - switch context e.g. for handling data input and output
- networking server/client 
- Testing: 
  - doctest
  see https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html
  - unittest
- after lunch lab exercise

Thursday
- recordings...
- pytest
- profiling
- multi threading, performance
- after lunch lab exercise
- logging - context mgr, by-month/by-day, db log, log access and format
- iterators __iter__
- named tuple
- zip
- deque, defaultdict etc
- all my code available online https://github.com/onionmccabbage/advpymar2022/upload/main
- feedback
